# YT-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and data for conducting a YouTube Data Analysis project using the YouTube Data API in Python and Tableau. The goal of this project is to gather channel statistics and video details for specific YouTube channels and then visualize the insights using Tableau's powerful data visualization capabilities.

## Introduction
YouTube is one of the most popular social media platforms with millions of content creators and viewers. This project aims to analyze the performance of specific YouTube channels by collecting data on their subscribers, total views, video count, and more. The data is then visualized using Tableau to gain valuable insights and present them in an engaging manner.

## Requirements
To run the data collection script and perform data analysis, you will need the following:

1) Python (3.x recommended) with the required libraries listed in requirements.txt.
2) A Google API Key to access the YouTube Data API.
3) Link to the website to get the Channel IDs: https://commentpicker.com/youtube-channel-id.php

## How to Create your own Youtube API Key
1) Create a Google Account: If you don't have a Google Account, you'll need to create one. Go to the Google Account Creation Page and follow the instructions to set up a new account.

2) Go to the Google Developer Console: Once you have a Google Account, go to the Google Developer Console.

3) Create a New Project: In the Google Developer Console, click on the "Select a Project" dropdown at the top of the page and then click on "New Project." Give your project a name and click "Create."

4) Enable the YouTube Data API: In the Google Developer Console, select your newly created project from the dropdown. Then, click on "Enable APIs and Services." Search for "YouTube Data API v3" and click on it. On the next page, click the "Enable" button.

5) Create Credentials: After enabling the YouTube Data API, click on "Create Credentials." Select "YouTube Data API v3" as the API you want to use and "Web server" as the type of data you're accessing. Choose "Application Data" as the data you'll be accessing and click "What credentials do I need?" button.

6) Set Up Consent Screen: If prompted, set up the consent screen. This screen allows you to define how your application will be identified to users. Choose "External" and click "Create."

7) Create API Key: You should now be on the "Create a new Client ID" page. However, since you only need an API Key, click on the "Create credentials" button at the top of the page. Select "API key" from the dropdown.

8) Get Your API Key: Your API key will be generated. Make sure to copy and save it in a safe place since you won't be able to see it again. Do not share your API key publicly or expose it in your code.

## Data Visualization
Tableau is used for data visualization, where interactive and informative charts, graphs, and dashboards are created based on the analyzed data. The visualizations provide insights into channel performance, video trends, and audience engagement.
